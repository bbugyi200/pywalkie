# What is Pywalkie?
A two-way walkie-talkie command-line application. The server should run daemonize the `pywalkie-server.py` script, at which point you can start a conversation from some other client machine by using the `pywalkie-client.py` script. The client machine has full control over the flow of the conversation.
